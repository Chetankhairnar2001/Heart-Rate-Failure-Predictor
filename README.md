# Heart-Rate-Failure-Predictor
## What does the project do?
Cardiovascular Diseases(CVD) are major of death globally to solve this problem using machine learning we created this project using 3 Supervised Machine Learning to identify causes of heart failure and to tackle it.

Comparing the 3 models with metrics Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score and Mean Absolute Error, we conclude that for current data KNN Algorithm gives optimal results

In conclusion, from our visualizations and model, our results demonstrate the ability of a machine learning to perform a classification task to solve of identifying which features are most effecting the Causes Heart Diseases and so to take prior care of the features.
